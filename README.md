Real-Time Organ Detection for Laparoscopic Surgery using YOLOv11n  This project implements a lightweight, high-performance organ detection model for live laparoscopic surgery using YOLOv11n. The goal is to support AI-assisted surgical workflows by providing accurate, low-latency organ localization during minimally invasive procedures.  Ke
