# Real-Time Organ Detection for Laparoscopic Surgery using YOLOv11n

A lightweight, high-performance computer vision system designed to detect organs in **live laparoscopic surgery** using **YOLOv11n**.  
This project explores how real-time AI can support surgeons by enhancing intra-operative visibility and reducing cognitive load during minimally invasive procedures.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the full pipeline for training, validating, and deploying an organ detection model optimized for **real-time surgical environments**.  
The model is trained on laparoscopic datasets and tuned to handle challenges such as:

- Occlusions  
- Surgical instrument interference  
- Low-light / variable illumination  
- Complex tissue textures  

The goal is to demonstrate how modern object detection architectures can be adapted for **medical AI** and **operating-room assistance systems**.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses **YOLOv11n** due to its balance of:

- High inference speed  
- Lightweight deployment footprint  
- Strong accuracy for small and medium objects  

Custom modifications were applied to improve detection stability during rapid camera motion and high-variance frames.
